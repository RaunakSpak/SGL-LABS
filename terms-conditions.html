                        general

                    <p><b>“Inspection”</b> means the procedure conducted by SGL in examining and assessing the Item
                        based

                        expertise and use of equipment, methodology, scientific technology, tools and other information
                        and
                        circumstances available at the time of the procedure. The exact scope of inspection shall be

                        predetermined classification, for and at the request of a Client. Colour grade is based on SGL
                        master comparison stones (studded & loose). Clarity grade is on 10x magnification. Grading is as
                        mounting permits. Measurements and weights are approximate and estimated.</p>

                        with the rules predetermined by SGL. The identification of gemstones and determination of their
                        various characteristics is dependent on tests carried out on various instruments and by
                        examination

                        of
                        the Client and for the exclusive use of the Client. The Client acknowledges and agrees that the
                        opinions indicated in a Report may differ from the matters as indicated in another report issued
                        before or after such Report, due to the technology and tools used for the Inspection or
                        subjective
                        elements at the time of the relevant Inspection. The Client further acknowledges that gemstone
                        testing, inspection, identification and grading is not an exact science. The Report represents
                        only
                        the best professional opinion of SGL, and accordingly SGL shall not be responsible for any
                        possible
                        dissimilarities and/or differences that could appear from repeated observations and/or use of
                        other
                        standards, norms, methods or criteria other than those chosen by SGL.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>In certain cases, because of the lack of evidence / characteristic features in the Item or lack
                        of
                        some specific equipment, the Item may be returned without performing the Service. Whenever SGL
                        deems
                        it impossible or impractical to perform the Service, SGL may terminate the respective request
                        and
                        inform the Client of such termination. In such a case, unless otherwise agreed between SGL and
                        the
                        Client, SGL shall return the fees received from the Client with respect to such request, if any,
                        together with the Item. The amount so returned shall not accrue any interest. SGL may deduct any
                        admin fees or other reimbursements against the time and attention given to the terminated
                        request.

                    <p>SGL in routine employs non-destructive methods of Identification, however, in certain cases

                    <p>SGL exclusively provides certification for natural diamonds, lab-grown gems, and precious gem
                        stones
                        that meet our established criteria. However, stimulants such as but not limited to Moissanite do
                        not
                        fall within the scope of our certification. SGL retains the discretion to decline certification
                        for
                        any stone. This determination may take into account various factors, including but not limited
                        to
                        quality, authenticity, and adherence to SGL compliance standards.</p>

                An SGL report/consultation/certificate (Hereinafter “report”), consists of findings made by SGL from
                grading, examining and analyzing the gemstone(s)/JEWELLERY/metal according to the highest professional
                standards and most specialized equipment available to conduct the test. The methods by which gemstones
                are treated/synthesized and metals are mixed, continue to become more sophisticated. Consequently, even
                when using the latest techniques and technologies, it will not always be possible to determine if they
                have been treated/synthesized or mixed and SGL offers no guarantees in this respect.
